			<h2>The Conditions of fund raising of ACS</h2>
			<p>This is the progress that ACS has made so far since 2010. There are some ups and downs in the income of funds. But these years it has been making steady progress. The income has reached up to 18000 last year. We hope to keep up this pace and keep helping animals as much as we can.</p>

			<h2>Ways Used To Raise Funds</h2>
			<p>Through out the years since it was found, the ACS has helped raising funds for the animal shelters around the country helping animals as much as they could. The funds are raised using various methods.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>A Walk with Our Best Buddies</dt>
				<dd>We organized a small festival like a costume party for the dogs and their masters in the town so that the people can bring their dogs and attend. At the festival, the owners and their pets can take part in it borrowing different kinds of costumes and playing games. The funds are brought in from the costume borrowing the games.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>Snap Photo Day</dt>
				<dd>ACS gathered some funds using this kind of method too. A special place was set for people to take a special picture of their pet taken by a photographer. The funds are collected from the fee for taking the picture. It's very successful. This way we get funds to come in.</dd>
